Python Polyseed library meant to be compatible with https://github.com/tevador/polyseed (the original C implementation),
built for [Monero Signer Resurrection](https://github.com/DiosDelRayo/MoneroSigner)

Todo:
 - [ ] refactor, so everything necessary is directly under the module (__init__.py) and only the necessary
 - [ ] some docs
 - [ ] clean up
